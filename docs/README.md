This website has been created as a fun game for people to play and to introduce people to 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' (RPSLS), a newer version of the traditional game, 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'.

The website features two main sections:

1. Showing you the rules of both 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and 'RPSLS' and a helpful graphic.

2. The Game Area where you can choose to play either game, with the full game history shown and scores calculated. 

## Goals of the Website

Business Goals:

- To create a website that is easy for users of all ages to use.

- To provide a fun and interactive way to play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' against the computer

- To educate people about 'RPSLS' and spread awareness in a fun way.


User Goals

- To learn about 'RPSLS' and how to play.

- To play 'RPSLS' against the computer.

- To easily see what moves were played and won in each game.


# UX

## Strategy

As it is the first pillar of UX, I started my project thinking about my target audience, and what they would be looking for in a website.   

I decided my Target Audience were:

- Children from 6+.
- Children who enjoy playing games on the computer.
- Children who are looking for a new game they can quickly pick up.

I decided my key features were:

- An explaination of the rules of 'RPSLS'
- Being able to play both 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and 'RPSLS'.
- Score tracking over multiple rounds.
- Display previous rounds and easily differentiate between winners and losers.

Overall the most important think for me was clear instructions and simple game mechanics so the website can be used by all ages.


## Scope

To achieve these goals I decided that my website needed the following features:

- Clear information explaining the rules of both games.
- A graphic showing the different game combinations visually.
- Start Buttons for each game that are clearly labeled.
- A table showing the current and previous results.
- An alert when you finish the game with a final score.
- A new game button so you can start again after each game.

## Structure

To keep the website easily digestible, I kept all the information on a single page. I did consider making the website multi-pages with landing pages for the end of games but this seemed like adding complexity for the sake of it without providing any extra value to the user. I also the website to be accesible on smaller screens, so added media queries putting the information and graphics in a single column, keeping it clear and easy to digest.

## Skeleton

You can view the wireframes I created for my website below.

## Surface

For my colour scheme, I chose a Sky Blue background and Black text. It is a soft blue that doesnt distract away from the game and provides good contrast from accesibility purposes. For my font, I selected 'Garamond' as its simple style fit my website well and it looks good as both a header and in paragraph text.
